### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
tr:last-child{
    border-bottom:none;
}
```
I learned this selector, before i learned this i was confused how can i remove the bottom border from last element in a table. 


### Continued development

My future plan is to master  more advanced CSS techniques such as animations and responsive design. Additionally, I would learn javascript and all its frameworks so i can become a proficient front-end developer. 

### Useful resources
